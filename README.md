# Image Processing Assignment - Edge Detection and Filtering

This repository contains solutions for the image processing assignment, which covers tasks such as detecting diagonal edges, applying edge detection filters, sharpening using smoothing, and implementing Gabor filters. The tasks are implemented from scratch, without relying on high-level OpenCV functions for the core image processing algorithms.

## Tasks

### Question 1: Detecting Diagonal Edges
- **Objective**: Design a simple Prewitt filter to detect 45° diagonal edges in a given image.
- **Input**: `Assignment_2_Image_1.png`
- **Approach**: A Prewitt filter was created to detect diagonal edges at a 45° angle by applying a custom convolution operation with the filter.

### Question 2: Edge Detection
- **Objective**: Detect intensity transitions (edges) in an image using a 5x5 Laplacian kernel with central coefficient 24 and all other coefficients as -1. 
- **Input**: `Assignment_2_Image_2.png`
- **Approach**: Implemented the Laplacian filter from scratch, then sharpened the image using the Laplacian of the Gaussian (LoG) kernel.
- **Comparison**: The difference between the results of using a Laplacian filter and the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) filter is analyzed.

### Question 3: Sharpening Using Smoothing
- **Objective**: Use Gaussian smoothing to sharpen an image using a Gaussian filter.
- **Input**: Provided kernel size of 3x3 and standard deviation of 1.
- **Approach**: Applied Gaussian smoothing to sharpen the image by convolving it with the Gaussian kernel.

### Question 4: Gabor Filtering
- **Objective**: Implement Gabor filters at different scales, orientations, and frequencies to detect edges in an image.
- **Input**: `Assignment_2_Image_1.png`
- **Specifications**:
  - Kernel size: 31x31
  - Standard deviation (𝜎): 1.0 and 3.0
  - Aspect ratio (𝛾): 0.5
  - Orientation (𝜃): 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°
  - Frequency (𝑓0): 0.1
  - Phase offset (ɸ): 0
- **Approach**: Constructed the Gabor filter kernels and used the real part of the complex Gabor filters to detect edges. The filtered images were generated by taking the maximum output at each pixel over all orientations.
- **Comparison**: The implementation is compared against OpenCV’s implementation of Gabor kernels using the same parameters.
